# 📈 FitSync | Holistic Health Intelligence

**FitSync** is a Python-based health analytics platform that bridges the gap between physical biometrics and mental well-being. Unlike standard fitness trackers that focus solely on movement, FitSync merges data from **Apple Health** (physical) and **Daylio** (mental) to provide a unified "Recovery Score."

### 🌐 Live Demo
Experience the interactive dashboard live in your browser:

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://fitsync-project-alicia-vargas.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Unified Dashboard:** A real-time overview of physical activity vs. mental reflections.
* **Trend Analysis:** Deep-dive correlations (Heatmaps) showing how sleep and steps directly impact mood.
* **The "Storyteller" Engine:** A custom logic layer that simulates realistic health correlations for demonstration purposes.
* **Dynamic Data Import:** Supports session-based CSV uploads for Apple Health and Daylio exports.
* **Responsive UI:** A clean, modern interface built with Streamlit.

## 🛠 Developer Notes: Dynamic Data Switching

FitSync features an intelligent **Smart-Switch** logic that ensures the dashboard is always functional:

* **Demo Mode:** If no files are uploaded, the app automatically pulls from `modules/demo_story.py` to showcase the visualizations and trend analysis.
* **Live Mode:** As soon as a user uploads their own Apple Health or Daylio exports via the sidebar, the app detects the presence of data in the `session_state`, clears the demo data, and renders personal analytics in real-time.

**Technical Implementation:** The switch is handled via a conditional check in `Home.py`, preventing the need for manual code commenting:
```python
if 'uploaded_apple' not in st.session_state and 'uploaded_daylio' not in st.session_state:
    df_filtered = apply_demo_logic(df_filtered) # Auto-Demo
else:
    # Live personal data processing
```

## 🧠 The Philosophy
The core of FitSync is the **Recovery Score**. This is a proprietary calculation that weights heart rate, sleep duration, and daily mood to tell the user not just how much they moved, but how ready they are for the day ahead.

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Statement
This project was developed using a "Human-in-the-Loop" AI workflow. While AI was utilized to streamline the building process, the core system architecture and data logic were human-led.

System Architecture: I designed the multi-page Streamlit framework and the dynamic state-management logic that allows the app to switch seamlessly between Demo Mode and Live Mode.

Proprietary Logic: I architected the Recovery Score Algorithm, defining how heart rate, sleep duration, and mood data are weighted and normalized to create a single actionable metric.

Data Engineering: I directed the development of the ETL pipeline, specifically the logic required to merge disparate schemas from Apple Health (XML/CSV) and Daylio (CSV) into a unified data structure.

AI as a Force Multiplier: Tools like Google Gemini and GitHub Copilot were used as pair-programmers to accelerate boilerplate generation, assist in complex Plotly visualization debugging, and ensure code PEP-8 compliance.
